# Fusion3-klipper-conversion
The fusion3 has a multitude of issues which I have found inefficient, so I converted it to klipper using the BTT e3ez, BTT CB1, EZ2209, Orbiter v2, and the BIQU microprobe.

please keep in mind commiting in this conversion will be relatively difficult depending on experience, please consider attempting this, if you have any issues, please email me at mjwarmington@outlook.com
